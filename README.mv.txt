my name is yazan dalbah, and I'm from palestine.
the project is a game was made by C# and unity engine
learning c# was ez becuase i already know C
the game is so simple since u the player just need to change between the shapes by W A S D to match the falling shape
it's an endless game but the falling shapes get faster over time so it becomes funnier and more challinging
and ur goal is geting the height score u can
this was final project 


sorry for bad english
